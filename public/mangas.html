<h1> The Best Mangas in 2024 </h1>
<h2> My Top 5 Mangas I Read This Year </h2>
<hr \>

<h3>Oyasumi Punpun </h3>
<p>Very realistic and makes you feel very empty when it ends, but it can also seem somewhat relatable and I loved it so much. </p>

<h3>Jagaaaaan </h3>
<p>The name is weird but a topnotch action, drama, and romance manga. </p>

<h3>The Promised Neverland </h3>
<p>The anime doesn't give it credit, the manga is still one of the best I have ever read. </p>

<h3>Leviathan </h3>
<p>One of the best Action webtoons I have ever read. Better than Solo Leveling and TBATE imo. </p>

<h3>She's Hopeless </h3>
<p>Not really in to romance Manhwa's, but this made my heart melt. </p>
